# The AI-Powered Weekly Brief
### Project Description
The AI-Powered Weekly Brief is a news site that automatically generates a concise podcast episode every week. The project aims to save listeners hours of research by providing digestible summaries of key news events.

### How It Works
The entire production pipeline is fully automated by a suite of AI agents:

- **Research:** An AI agent is responsible for aggregating and researching news from various sources to find the most important stories of the week.

- **Script Writing:** A Large Language Model (LLM) takes the research data and crafts a professional, human-like script for the podcast episode.

- **Audio Creation:** A Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine converts the final script into a high-fidelity audio file, ready for distribution.

### Technologies Used
- **Research Agent:** Google Gemini, Powered by Tavily's reaserch agent framework.
- **LLM:** Google Gemini.

- **TTS:** Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
